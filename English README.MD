## [Minecraft Transit Railway Snapshot Versions Chineseization Project] - MTR Snapshot Versions Chineseization Project
## What was this project created for?
### The snapshot version of the MinecraftTransitRailway module has lost all language translations except English since version 3.0.0-beta8-UnofficialSnapshot3 because it does not support Crowdin translation.
### It has caused inconvenience for many module players, including a language barrier. 
### This project was created to facilitate Chinese players.
### It will help Chinese players to play MTR more easily.
